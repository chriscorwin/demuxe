/* Your styles here */


// THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO DO IT

// UNCOMMENT THE CODE AND RELOAD TO SEE IT IN USE
/* 
#content-wrapper {
	margin-top: 10rem;
}
*/

// NOW: you don't actually _want_ to do it this way though :D

// Instead try adding a couple of [SLDS utility classnames](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/utilities/margin/) to your #content element (in the wrapper file). You will need both `slds-m-top_xx-large` and `slds-p-top_xx-large` on there to get the proper amount of spacing.
